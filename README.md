# codebyte-atm
# I have created a very basic python ATM controller that can be run from the command line.
# The prompt asks for a card and pin number which are "123456789" and "1234" respetfully without the quotes.
# There will also be certain actions you can run as well as error messages.
# This is very basic and simple since I did it in a short amount of time.
